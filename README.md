Those who earn the Google Cybersecurity Certificate have completed eight courses, developed by Google, that include hands-on, practice-based assessments and are designed to prepare them for entry-level roles in cybersecurity.

They are competent in beginner-level Python, Linux, SQL, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). They know how to identify common cybersecurity risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as the techniques to mitigate.

The focus of this Portfolio was to gather, improve and complete activies related to Cyber Security and presented in Google's Professional Cyber Security Specialization offered through Coursera.

This course covered topics such as:

Risk management
Threat analysis
Network security
Incident response

It taught me new technical skills in:


Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)
SIEM Tools (Chronicle and Splunk)
IDS/IPS Tools
Firewalls

And I was able to brush up on a lot of fundamental information and develop even further in the following skills:

Python
SQL
Linux
